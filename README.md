# Instructions for running local server:

Make sure you're using a virtual environment, to maintain consistency in package versions.

```
$ pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
$ python3 main.py
```

Make sure to check your local server when making changes before pushing to production!
To push changes to production:

1. Pull GitHub files (git clone https://github.com/undergrad-lab-at-berkeley/website.git)
2. Make changes
3. Test changes locally
4. Push to GitHub ("git add <FILES>" or "git add \*" to add everything)
5. SSH to server with: "ssh ulab@apphost.ocf.berkeley.edu"
6. See credential info and other VERY IMPORTANT information here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lwv4SWmI5_76DveJEai9_hve2NqTfYH4dLPCtza9ny4/edit
7. Pull the changes to the server
8. Restart the app
  
Note: steps 7 and 8 run ``. deploy`` in myapp.
