                        Founded in Fall 2017 by Jenna Martin and Riley McDanal, the Psych & CogSci Lab has a vision of offering an experience that benefits all undergraduates in the research community.  Experienced researchers can attain leadership roles within this lab setting while facilitating the training and growth of aspiring researchers so that each group is primed for more advanced research opportunities. </br>

                        This year, we are following a replicate and extend structure. Mentees will be divided into groups of 4-5 and assigned a mentor that will guide them through a year-long project. The first semester will be spent replicating a published study and the second semester will be spent extending the methods based on an original idea. The studies will be provided through a database compiled by the ULab Board of Directors and dedicated graduate students. Each group will get to pick studies in areas that interest them the most. This will also allow an opportunity for projects to be published!
                        <p><p/>
                        Our projects this year involve social psychology, fMRI analyses, visual field cortices, language processing, among others. All projects will be published in a paper and poster series via UC eScholarship Open Access publishing. Posters will be presented to notable UC Berkeley faculty. This will certainly aid in getting on-campus research.
                        <p><p/>
                        Currently, Dr. Mark D'Esposito, Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at UC Berkeley, serves as primary faculty advisor. As the ULab Board of Directors pursues new projects and initiatives, Dr. D'Esposito oversees their work to ensure the advancement of ULab's mission.

                        The Undergraduate Lab at Berkeley, Physics &#38; Astronomy Division is a DeCal that aims to make the transition into undergraduate research as seamless as possible. <b>We believe that research should be accessible to all undergrads within the Physics and Astronomy Departments</b> despite significant barriers to entry for students traditionally underrepresented in academia or without a strong research background.
                        <br><br>
                        Under the guidance of experienced undergraduate mentors and graduate/postdoc advisors, groups of mentees complete a year long research project on a topic of their interest. During this process, our staff will help mentees are able to make sense of the current literature, isolate a feasible project, and execute projects on a reasonable timescale. In addition, mentors serve as role-models to help demystify the research process.
                        <br><br>
                        Our program, extends beyond project work. Students attend weekly workshops on essential research skills such as programming, statistics, etc. At the end of our program, students will have gained basic research skills often desired by research labs and will have demonstrated these skills in the process of completing a project of their own from start-to-finish.

                        <b>Q: What are the prerequisites for ULAB?</b>
                        <br>
                        None! Many students are first and seconds years with no prior research or programming experience. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Q: I'm a junior/junior transfer/senior, should I apply?</b>
                        <br>
                        Definitely! Many upperclassmen have found ULAB helpful in obtaining research experience. However, ULAB may not be the right choice if you already feel prepared to join a lab or have very little time left at Berkeley. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Q: How competitive is the program?</b>
                        <br>
                        We accept as many students as possible. In the event that space is limited, students that benefit most from our program have priority. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Q: How are project topics choosen?</b><br>
                        Available topics are determined by out cohort of mentors and vary year by year. We are able to normally cover the major subfields in physics and astronomy. Mentees have a large say in the mentor/project they work on.<br><br>
                        <b>Q: Can I apply to ULAB in addition to other research programs?</b><br>
                        Yes. Students that join ULAB, but are subsequently accepted into another program (e.g. URAP) may pursue both concurrently or drop ULAB before the drop deadline late September.              
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Q: Do ULAB projects yeild results?</b><br>
                        Wrong question. ULAB is a <i>research training</i> organization. Through conducting their projects, mentees learn about the basic knowledge and skills required to conduct research in their field and leave our program a better candidate, and better prepared for research. (…but to answer the question, most projects do yield interesting results; and even when they don’t, mentees are able to explain their work and what they’ve learned).

                        Mentorship can be a very fruitful and rewarding experience for undergraduates with research experience. Mentors' primary job is to meet weekly with their group of 3-5 mentees during the year-long process of conducting an independent research project. Mentors will lead discussions on topics in their field and guide their group through their project.
                        <br><br>
                        Mentorship is a unique <i>learning</i> opportunity. Mentors will expereince the process of leading a scientific project, conduct research in a topic of their interest, and interact with fellow undergraduate and graduate researchers. <b>Mentors are generously supported by the <a href="https://evcp.berkeley.edu/news/announcing-berkeley-discover-departmental-innovation-awardees">Physics + Astronomy Berkeley Discover Initiative</a> and will recieve $600/semester stipend.

                        <b>Q: What is the committment?</b><br>
                        Mentorship is a 2-semester positions. Mentors meet with their groups 1-2 hrs/week and generally spend an additional 1-3 hours outside of in-person meetings. We require that mentors be available Wednesday 7-8 PM and enroll in 2 research units (Astron. 198).<br><br>
                        <b>Q: How much research experience is expected?</b><br>
                        Mentors are not expected to be experts, but should be comfortable exploring their field. They must be prepared to help mentees learn about a new topic, and to learn about a new topic/project themselves. At least 1 semester of research in a group is recommended.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Q: How are project topics choosen</b>
                        <br>
                        While some mentors have a clear project in mind, most mentors begin an idea of topics they would like to work on. They are paired with mentees with similar interests. Mentors and mentees together determine a suitable project. We are able to reasonably fund physical projects, simulations, etc.

                Founded in Spring 2021, the Computational Biology Division of the Undergraduate Lab at Berkeley, aims to give interested undergraduates a chance to conduct their own research projects in Computational Biology in small groups under the guidance of experienced undergraduate mentors. Along the way they will gain fundamental research skills, explore relevant background knowledge, and gain experience in the research process. Our goal is to help students feel confident and prepared to seek out on-campus opportunities in the exciting field of computational biology. <br/>
                The lab will meet as a DeCal over the course of one semester. Students will spend class time learning background information and meeting with their groups to work on their project. Mentors will supervise groups of 4-6 students, and guide them through the process of exploring a research question. The DeCal will conclude with a final project presentation. See the course syllabus <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WxTg71qLSEaavCrHTgWb5uFt_6mG3nzr">here</a>, and our decal page <a href="https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/5458">here</a>!<br/>.

                        The Data Science Lab, started by Alan Pham in Fall 2018, is a great opportunity for students to conduct data science research by working on an interesting project, with guidance from experienced undergraduate mentors. It might seem difficult, but it’s actually very fun and easy, because of our unique way of providing students a gentle introduction to research. For mentors, this is a meaningful opportunity to lead aspiring researchers while getting to know what it might be like to lead a lab. <br/>

                        <br/>

                        Data science is becoming an increasingly important field, and the ability to understand, analyze, and clearly communicate data is valuable in any field, so we encourage everyone to study it. Projects can be about anything you choose, as long as it deals with data. Possible areas of interest could be education, business, technology, health, sports, sociology, government, etc. Basically, anything you learn about or observe in life can be analyzed with data science, so this is a great chance for students of all majors to explore any research topics of their interest. For example, you could investigate factors that increase risk for certain diseases, develop a predictive model for election results, or identify factors that increase school test scores. This is a very beneficial and worthwhile opportunity, and we hope you can join as a researcher or mentor. <br>

            <h4>Astrophysics</h4>
                <p>The Astrophysics branch of uLab provides an academic outlet for first-year students with an interest in space physics, exoplanets, cosmology, and much more, regardless of their intended majors. While Astrophysics uLab functions as a gateway to classes and research opportunities for those who decide to pursue astrophysics research in the future, those who do not will leave the program with the benefits of a broad range of academic skills, research experience, and an heightened understanding of basic astrophysics.</p>
                <p>In this sense, uLab welcomes passionate students more than anything else. From those determining their interest in a major to those to those already sure, uLab Astrophysics is a great place to improve research paper literacy, experimental design and computer programming skills, in addition to participating in the epicenter of important interdisciplinary discoveries.</p>
                <p>The astrophysics branch currently supports two separate projects, the first being on exoplanetary atmospheric analysis. By using open-sourced data from NASA’s Kepler mission, the group plans to create an automated method of categorizing various exoplanet’s atmospheric compositions and habitability likelihood.</p>
                <p>The second of the astrophysics projects focuses on black holes. By comparing the results of an existing research paper making use of RELXILL with those calculated from the new FENRIR model, students will examine black hole spins and hone computational skills.</p>
            <h4>Condensed Matter</h4>
                <p>The Condensed Matter branch of uLab allows students with an interest in atomic and molecular physics to investigate the mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of nanomaterials and nanostructures. Students who join the condensed matter team will learn about the various techniques and methods that are prevalent throughout the field. We work closely with research groups in the physics department. Current areas of research at Berkeley are quantum information, physics of nanomaterials, magnetism, quantum materials, optical properties, photoemission, superconductivity, and new materials. Our undergraduate mentors are involved in various condensed matter research groups, and can share their experience in the field as they guide students in their projects.</p>
                <p>Given the interdisciplinary nature of the field of condensed matter, students from various majors, such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and engineering are welcome to join. Students interested in developing applicable research skills, such as learning how to write research papers, being introduced to working in a laboratory environment, and professional development are invited to pursue independent research with our undergraduate mentors.</p>
                <p>The condensed matter branch of uLab is currently running projects in graphene deposition and high-temperature superconductors. In the graphene project, we compare two chemical vapor deposition techniques. Between both growth methods, we will compare the prevalence of surface defects and deformations in graphene, and the yield and quality of growth.
            <h4>Particle Physics</h4>
                <p>The uLab Particle Physics Group allows first-year students interested in particle, nuclear, and high-energy physics to learn about the research community at Berkeley while performing new research in fundamental physics. This semester, the particle physics group is investigating the possibility of active cosmic ray shielding using magnetic fields in order to reduce the noise in precision particle physics experiments. The group will be constructing a particle detector and measuring the reduction in particle intensity when different shielding designs are used. In the process, students will also learn about statistics and data analysis as well as software commonly used in the particle physics. An effective shield will allow the group to pursue other precision experiments without the interference of cosmic rays.</p>
